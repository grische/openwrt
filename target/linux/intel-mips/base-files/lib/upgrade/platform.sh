# NAND layout (seale_avm_fritz7560.dts, seale_avm_fritz7580.dts,
# seale_avm_fritz7590.dts): two raw 8 MiB kernel slots, each holding a bare EVA
# container, plus a "ubi" partition holding the rootfs and rootfs_data volumes.
#
# BOTH kernel slots are written, with the same container, and that is the whole
# point of this file. Which slot EVA boots is chosen by linux_fs_start in the
# boot-loader environment, which is *runtime state*: the boot loader may change
# it on its own. Reading it and writing only the slot it names cannot work -- it
# may change after the write -- and a fixed choice cannot work either, because
# the variable moves. Writing both makes the question moot, and makes EVA's
# fallback self-healing: whichever slot it picks holds the kernel that matches
# the rootfs.
#
# This replaces relying on nand.sh's CI_KERNPART default, which silently wrote
# one slot: on a board whose linux_fs_start pointed at the other one, sysupgrade
# reported success at every layer and the device kept running its old kernel.
#
# Partitions are addressed by NAME throughout; the boards number them
# differently.
