  # FRITZ.Box_7560-07.11 GPL drop: these boards were brought up and tested
  # on R8548, and with the xRx3xx blob the loader reports success and the
  # links stay down.
  #
  # fritz-tffs-nand, not fritz-tffs: the two package names build different
  # binaries for two incompatible on-flash layouts. fritz-tffs reads the
  # NOR-flash scheme, a pair of mirrored partitions read through a plain
  # file or mtdblock; this board carries the NAND scheme, a single 4 MiB
  # log-structured partition whose per-entry tags live in the pages' spare
  # area, which only fritz_tffs_nand knows how to walk (and which it reaches
  # through the mtd char device, for the OOB ioctl). Shipping the NOR tool
  # here left the box with no way to read its own MAC addresses.
  #
  # fritz-caldata provides fritz_cal_extract, which pulls the per-unit WiFi
  # calibration blobs out of the urlader partition. The two
  # hotplug.d/firmware scripts in ../base-files are what call it.
  #
  # pciutils is bring-up instrumentation for the PCIe host bridges. lspci
  # -vv is the only thing that distinguishes the three ways this bridge
  # can fail — PHY/link never trained, link trained but config reads come
  # back all-ones, and config reads work but the capability chain does not
  # walk — which are indistinguishable from the kernel log alone. It drags
  # in libpci and the pciids database; both can go once the radios are up.
  #
  # The two WiFi radios sit on the first two PCIe root complexes. 5 GHz is
  # a QCA9882 (168c:003c, QCA988X hw2.0) driven by kmod-ath10k; 2.4 GHz is
  # an AR93xx 3x3 part reporting the blank ID 168c:abcd, which binds to
  # plain kmod-ath9k. Not kmod-owl-loader: its PCI table covers
  # 168c:ff1c/168c:ff1d only and never matches 0xabcd. The ID that does
  # match comes from mac80211's own
  # patches/ath9k/513-ath9k_add_pci_ids.patch, and the EEPROM then reaches
  # the driver over ath9k's DT qca,no-eeprom path.
  #
  # ath10k-firmware-qca988x drags in ath10k-board-qca988x, which is what
  # actually matters here: board.bin is not optional just because the
  # calibration blob is supplied by file. ath10k_core_fetch_board_file()
  # hard-errors without it and the radio never registers.
  #
  # wpad-basic-mbedtls rather than the wolfssl or openssl flavour, to match
  # the mbedtls this image already links, and to match the lantiq AVM
  # siblings. Without a wpad/hostapd variant the radios come up but can
  # only run open or client-mode; there is no AP encryption.
  #
  # 802.11ac for the QCA9882 needs DRIVER_11AC_SUPPORT, a hidden
  # (bool, default n) symbol in package/network/services/hostapd/Config.in.
  # Nothing here sets it by hand — kmod-ath10k carries +@DRIVER_11AC_SUPPORT,
  # which makes selecting the module select the symbol. That is also why
  # the .config for this device must be regenerated with `make defconfig`
  # rather than edited: hand-writing the line does not survive.
  #
  # USB. The dwc3 controller, its xHCI half and the USB PHY are built into
  # the kernel from ../config-6.18, so none of them is re-stated here:
  # listing kmod-usb-core or kmod-usb-dwc3 alongside a =y symbol installs an
  # empty package and a "NOTICE: module ... is built-in." line, nothing
  # more. kmod-usb3 is absent for a sharper reason than redundancy — its
  # KCONFIG is "CONFIG_USB_PCI=y CONFIG_USB_XHCI_PCI CONFIG_USB_XHCI_PLATFORM",
  # so selecting it would reverse the deliberate "# CONFIG_USB_PCI is not
  # set" in the kernel fragment and build xhci-pci for a bus that carries
  # the two radios and no xHCI endpoint at all.
  #
  # What belongs here instead is everything that only matters once
  # something is plugged in, kept modular so a size-constrained build can
  # drop it without touching the kernel fragment.
  #
  # kmod-usb-storage is the bulk-only mass-storage class driver. Its
  # "+kmod-scsi-core" is a hard dependency and therefore becomes a select,
  # which is why it cannot be lost to a stale negative the way the entries
  # below can; kmod-scsi-core is also what supplies CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD,
  # without which a stick enumerates and no /dev/sda ever appears.
  #
  # kmod-usb-storage-uas adds UAS/UASP. It earns its place specifically
  # because this is a SuperSpeed port: a USB3 device that speaks UAS falls
  # back to bulk-only without it, which works but caps throughput far below
  # what the link can carry — and throughput on that link is exactly what
  # the bring-up gate for this phase measures.
  #
  # kmod-fs-vfat and kmod-fs-ext4 are the two filesystems a stick
  # realistically arrives formatted with. Not exfat, ntfs3 or f2fs: each is
  # another module for a case nothing here needs yet, and any of them
  # installs later with opkg. vfat drags in kmod-nls-base and the
  # cp437/iso8859-1/utf8 codepages through AddDepends/nls. nls_base itself
  # ends up built in rather than modular, because CONFIG_USB selects NLS and
  # a Kconfig select overrides generic's "# CONFIG_NLS is not set" — so that
  # one package installs empty, exactly as it does on lantiq.
  #
  # block-mount is what turns any of the above into a mounted filesystem:
  # block-hotplug, mount_root's fstab handling and the /etc/config/fstab UCI
  # schema. Without it the stick enumerates, the partition table is parsed,
  # /dev/sda1 exists — and nothing ever mounts it. It is not inherited from
  # anywhere: DEFAULT_PACKAGES.nas in include/target.mk is keyed on
  # DEVICE_TYPE=nas, and the "usb" FEATURES token adds no packages at all.
  #
  # usbutils is bring-up instrumentation, in the same spirit as pciutils
  # above. "lsusb -t" is what separates the three ways this controller can
  # fail — xhci-hcd never probes, it probes but no root hub registers, or
  # the root hub is there and the port never leaves Powered — which the
  # kernel log alone does not distinguish. It is a feed package and drags in
  # usbids and libusb-1.0; all three can go once the port is proven.
  #
  # kmod-leds-gpio is named here rather than in ../xrx500/target.mk because it
  # is this board's answer and not the subtarget's: every LED on the 7560 hangs
  # off a raw SoC GPIO, while the 7590 drives its panel through the SSO shift
  # register and takes kmod-leds-lgm-sso instead.

  # There is no 7590 bootcore, and borrowing the 7560's is not an option here:
  # that blob declares ram-size = <256>, and its protect_unattached() programs
  # a deny-all NGI fabric region over everything above that — the upper half of
  # a 512 MiB board, denied to every initiator. With no second record the 4Kec
  # core never starts, protect_unattached() never runs, and the region never
  # exists. Verified on this board from RAM and out of the NAND kernel slot,
  # each boot showing zero "ngi:" lines and no bootcore.
  #
  # What the DTS then declares is 256 MiB of the board's 512, and the cap is at
  # 0x30000000 for a reason that has nothing to do with the bootcore: it is the
  # top of the uncached window. seale_avm_fritz7590.dts's memory node carries
  # that derivation, the parked work that would recover the full width, and the
  # standing warning that the blob is single-kernel-only.
  #
  # ⚠ Therefore: do not reintroduce a second kernel record here. The recipe that
  # packed one and the package that staged the blob are both gone from this
  # tree, which is the intent rather than an accident; image/Makefile's
  # Build/eva-single-kernel says what a kernel2 record would re-arm.

  # KERNEL_INITRAMFS is restated rather than inherited. $$(Device/AVM) sets it to

  # Note 252 KiB, not the 248 KiB a no-subpage chip would give — that is the

  #
  # Confirmation on the first boot that probes this NAND is one read:
  # /sys/class/mtd/mtd4/subpagesize should be 1024, and UBI should report
  # "LEB size: 258048 bytes" with "sub-page size 1024". That value earns the

  # shows up. The subpage exists *because* nand-ecc-mode = "on-die" resolved
  # and the manufacturer init ran with ecc.size = 512; if the binding had
  # failed silently, which is the standing trap on this property, the engine
  # would not be ON_DIE, that init would never run, and subpagesize would read

  # The 7590's list unchanged. Both radios are QCA9984 here too, one per PCIe
  # root complex, so kmod-ath10k with the qca9984 firmware and board data; and
  # the front panel hangs off the same SSO shift register, so kmod-leds-lgm-sso
  # rather than kmod-leds-gpio.
  #
  # fritz-caldata is the one entry this board may not need. Unlike the 7560 and
  # the 7590, whose per-unit calibration blobs sit zlib-compressed in the
  # urlader, this board's urlader holds none: a scan of all eight partitions of
  # a full NAND backup found no zlib stream and no QCA9984 board-data
  # signature anywhere, so the radios calibrate from on-chip OTP instead and
  # ../base-files' 11-ath10k-caldata extracts nothing for this board. The
  # package is kept anyway, as bring-up insurance: that is host-side forensics
  # on a dump and the radios have not yet come up under our kernel. Drop it
  # once both radios are proven to associate on OTP calibration alone.

# All three devices, in the one subtarget. This used to be a guarded block per
# board, because the kernel carried a built-in DTB chosen at compile time:
# naming more than one would have let a build produce one board's image on top
# of a kernel holding another board's device tree, which assembles cleanly and
# fails only on hardware. The DTB now arrives appended to each device's own
# image, so the kernel binary is board-agnostic and that failure no longer has
# a mechanism — which is also what makes adding a third device here free.
